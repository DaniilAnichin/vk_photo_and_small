Vigenere coder by Dann

This is a simple script to encrypt and decrypt your information using the Vigenere cipher.

To launch it from the command line, you should type something like
    c:\way\to\folder\coder.py to What_to_encode key 
if you want to encrypt, and
    c:\way\to\folder\coder.py from What_to_decode key

First make sure that you What_to_**code and key contains only few kinds of symbols:
  Numbers: 0-9
  Letters: a-z, A-Z
  Some punctuation: ',. "()+-/*:;!?_ (Space is also there, surely)
  
Notice, that this script divides upper- and lowercase, pay attention while typing (key, especially)
